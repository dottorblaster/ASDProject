#### ASDProject - My mini-work
## The file
I user a monolitic class to write all this messy garbage. If you understand what I've done, you are a master of the human mind :)

## Documentation
Most of the fundamental functions are well commented, in italian, following Javadoc markup specification. There is all you need to know.
